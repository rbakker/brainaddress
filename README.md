# Brain Addressing System
A *brain address* is a pointer to a well-defined *location* in a well-defined *brain atlas*.
The *location* part can be as simple as an x,y,z-coordinate or brain region acronym.
The *brain atlas* part can be as simple as the combination of two acronyms:
that of the *brain atlas provider*, and that of the atlas that the provider hosts.
For example, the address
`brainaddress:sba/ABA_v3?coord=1,2,3`
points to coordinate (1,2,3) in atlas *ABA_v3* hosted by provider *sba*.
